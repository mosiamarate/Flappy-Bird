# Flappy Bird Game by Mosia Marate

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.2-blue)

This project showcases a Flappy Bird game developed by me, Mosia Marate, using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. Inspired by the classic game, players guide a bird through obstacles to achieve the highest score possible.

## Gameplay

Your goal is to control the bird, helping it navigate through pipes while avoiding collisions. Press the spacebar to make the bird flap upward, but time your movements carefully to avoid falling or hitting obstacles. If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends.
